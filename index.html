<h1 style="font-size:300%;">On no. 5 we have : Midway Islands</h1>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Nearly 5 million members of 17 species of seabirds nest on the islands, including 2 million albatrosses; both Laysan and Black-footed. 80% of the world's population of Laysan albatrosses are found at Midway, more affectionately known as the "gooney bird" for their awkward landings and especially for their entertaining mating rituals. Endangered Hawaiian monk seals (7-8 feet, up to 500 lbs) haul themselves onto land to rest and to give birth and raise their young. Giant green sea turtles (up to 400 lbs) are frequent visitors and have recently been documented nesting on Midways beaches, and a pod of 250-300 spinner dolphins lives and often performs acrobatics in and around the atoll's shallow lagoon. A flock of about 500 feral canaries exist, having been introduced by the Commercial Pacific Cable Company in 1903. There is also a small but growing population of Laysan ducks, the most endangered waterfowl in the northern hemisphere.

The islands also contain memorials and artifacts of the 1942 Battle of Midway. As well as the original Cable buildings erected in 1903.</p>
