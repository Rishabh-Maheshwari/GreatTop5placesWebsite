<h1 style="font-size:300%;">On no. 1 we have : Salar De Uyni, Bolivia</h1>
<p style="font-size: 160%">Salar de Uyuni (or Salar de Tunupa) is the largest salt lake in the world, having 10,582 square kilometers (4,086 square meters). It is located in southwest Bolivia, near the Andes and it is a place of breathtaking and unworldly views. The salt here can reach up to 10 meters in thickness. This incredible place is a mixture of stacked layers, as water and salt alternate. This means that if someone were to dig, he would find a lot of surprises along the way. We have an explanation for the amazing images below- which are as real as it gets. There are two seasons with distinct characteristics in Salar de Uyuni. one that is dry, when this landscape looks like an immense plain of salt and one that is wet, when the salt is covered with a sheet of water which doesnâ€™t affect driving.

In this stunning surroundings it is hard to see the exact spot where the sky touches its reflected image in the salt lake. In some images it looks like they are one and the same. </p>
